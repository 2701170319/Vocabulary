## 　**中英文演讲稿：**

　　**Today we are launching a campaign called “He For She.”**

　　今天，我们启动了一项名为“他为她”的运动。

------

　　**I am reaching out to you because I need your help. We want to end gender inequality—and to do that we need everyone to be involved.**

　　我向你伸出手，因为我需要你的帮助。我们希望终结性别不平等——为此，我们需要所有人都参与其中。

------

　　**This is the first campaign of its kind at the UN: we want to try and galvanize as many men and boys as possible to be advocates for gender equality. And we don’t just want to talk about it, but make sure it is tangible.**

　　这是联合国同类运动中的第一项：我们希望努力并激励尽可能多的男人和男孩倡导性别平等。而且希望这(性别平等)不只是空谈，而是确确实实的看得见摸得着。

------

　　**I was appointed six months ago and the more I have spoken about feminism the more I have realized that fighting for women’s rights has too often become synonymous with man-hating. If there is one thing I know for certain, it is that this has to stop.**

　　六个月前，我被任命为联合国妇女亲善大使。而随着我谈论女权主义越多，我越发现，“争取女性权益”太容易被当作是“憎恨男人”的同义词。如果说有一件事是我确实知道的，那就是，这样的误解必须停止。

------

　　**For the record, feminism by definition is: “The belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities. It is the theory of the political, economic and social equality of the sexes.”**

　　必须郑重声明，女权主义的定义是：“相信男性和女性应该拥有平等权利和机会。它是性别间政治、经济和社会平等的理论。”

------

　　**I started questioning gender-based assumptions when at eight I was confused at being called “bossy,” because I wanted to direct the plays(戏剧)we would put on for our parents—but the boys were not.**

　　8岁时，我开始质疑某些基于性别的假设。我不明白，为什么我想在为家长上演的戏剧里担任导演，就会被说成“专横”，而男孩们则不会；

------

　　**When at 14 I started being sexualized by certain elements of the press.**

　　14岁时，我开始被媒体报道的某些元素性别化；

------

　　**When at 15 my girlfriends started dropping out of their sports teams because they didn’t want to appear “muscly.”**

　　15岁时，我的女性朋友们开始退出各自的运动队，因为她们不希望显得“肌肉发达”；

------

　　**When at 18 my male friends were unable to express their feelings.**

　　18岁时，我的男性朋友们无法表达他们的感受。

------

　　**I decided I was a feminist and this seemed uncomplicated to me. But my recent research has shown me that feminism has become an unpopular word.**

　　我认为自己是一名女权主义者，这(身份认定)对我来说并不难。但我最近的调查发现，女权主义已经成为一个不受欢迎的词。

------

　　**Apparently I am among the ranks of women whose expressions are seen as too strong, too aggressive, isolating, anti-men and,unattractive.**

　　显然，我成了那些言辞看起来过于强势、过于激进、孤立、反男性、不吸引人的女性行列中的一员。

------

　　**Why is the word such an uncomfortable one?**

　　为什么这个词如此令人不安？

------

　　**I am from Britain and think it is right that as a woman I am paid the same as my male counterparts. I think it is right that Is hould be able to make decisions about my own body. I think it is right that women be involved on my behalf in the policies and decision-making of my country. I think it is right that socially I am afforded the same respect as men. But sadly I can say that there is no one country in the world where all women can expect to receive these rights.**

　　我来自英国，我认为身为女性，我应该和男性同行获得一样的报酬。我认为我应该自己为自己的身体做决定。我认为应该有女性代表我参与政治，以及我的国家的决策制定。我认为在社会上，我应该和男性获得相同的尊重。但遗憾的是，世界上没有一个国家能使所有的女性都能获得上述权利。

------

　　**No country in the world can yet say they have achieved gender equality.**

　　世界上没有一个国家能说，他们已经实现了性别平等。

------

　　**These rights I consider to be human rights but I am one of the lucky ones. My life is a sheer privilege because my parents didn’t love me less because I was born a daughter. My school did not limit me because I was a girl. My mentors didn’t assume I would go less far because I might give birth to a child one day. These influencers were the gender equality ambassadors that made who I am today. They may not know it, but they are thein advertent feminists who are. And we need more of those. And if you still hate the word—it is not the word that is important but the idea and the ambition behind it. Because not all women have been afforded the same rights that I have. In fact, statistically, very few have been.**

　　这些权利，我认为是每个人都该享有，然而(事实是)我只是众多幸运儿中的一个。我的生活是完完全全的特例，因为我的父母没有因为我生为女儿而减少对我的爱，我的学校没有因为我是女孩而限制我，我的导师没有因为我将来可能要生孩子而认为我会走不远。这些影响了我的人，都是性别平等大使，是他们造就了今天的我。他们也许并不知道，但他们是无心的女权主义者。而我们现在，则需要更多这样的人。所以，如果你仍然憎恨这个词——重要的不是这个词，而是它背后的想法和抱负。因为并不是所有女性都能够享有我所拥有的权利。事实上，从统计数据看，真的非常少。

------

　　**In 1997, Hilary Clinton made a famous speech in Beijing about women’s rights. Sadly many of the things she wanted to change are still a reality today.**

　　1997年，希拉里克林顿在北京做了一个关于女性权益的着名演讲。很遗憾，很多她希望改变的事实今天仍存在。

------

　　**But what stood out for me the most was that only 30per cent of her audience were male. How can we affect change in the world when only half of it is invited or feel welcome to participate in the conversation?**

　　我注意到，听众里只有30%是男性。当只有世界上的一半的人参与并融入这场对话时，我们怎么可能做出影响世界的改变？

------

　　**Men—I would like to take this opportunity to extend your formal invitation. Gender equality is your issue too.**

　　男人们——我希望利用这个机会正式的邀请你们加入。性别平等也与你们有关。

------

　　**Because to date, I’ve seen my father’s role as a parent being valued less by society despite my needing his presence as a child as much as my mother’s.**

　　因为到目前为止，我看到，我父亲作为家长所发挥的作用被社会所低估，虽然作为孩子，我所需要的他的陪伴和我需要母亲的一样多。

------

　　**I’ve seen young men suffering from mental illness unable to ask for help for fear it would make them look less “macho”—in fact in the UK suicide is the biggest killer of men between 20-49; eclipsing road accidents, cancer and coronary heart disease. I’ve seen men made fragile and insecure by a distorted sense of what constitutes male success. Men don’t have the benefits of equality either.**

　　我看到，年轻男性因为害怕自己显得不够“男子汉大丈夫”，从而在承受心理困扰时窘于寻求帮助——事实上，在英国，自杀已经是20-49岁男性的第一死亡原因，比交通事故、癌症和冠心病造成的死亡都多。我看到，男人因为对男性成功的扭曲理解而感到脆弱和不安全。性别不平等对男性也没有好处。

------

　　**We don’t often talk about men being imprisoned by gender stereotypes but I can see that that they are and that when they are free, things will change for women as a natural consequence.**

　　我们并不常谈及男人因为性别刻板印象而入狱，不过我可以看到，事情真是这样。并且当他们自由时，女性的境遇也会自然发生变化。

------

　　**If men don’t have to be aggressive in order to be accepted women won’t feel compelled to be submissive. If men don’t have to control, women won’t have to be controlled.**

　　如果男性不再为了被认可而变得强势好斗，女性也不会再感到被迫逆来顺受。如果男性不再被迫掌控一切，女性也不会再被迫受掌控。

------

　　**Both men and women should feel free to be sensitive.Both men and women should feel free to be strong… It is time that we all perceive gender on a spectrum not as two opposing sets of ideals.**

　　男人和女人都可以敏感；男人和女人都可以强壮……是时候把性别理解为光谱，而不是南辕北辙的两派。

------

　　**If we stop defining each other by what we are not and start defining ourselves by what we are—we can all be freer and this is what He For She is about. It’s about freedom.**

　　如果我们不再把对方定义为自己的对立面，而是把对方定义为我们的一员——我们都会更加自由。这就是“他为她”运动所倡导的。这就是自由。

------

　　**I want men to take up this mantle. So their daughters,sisters and mothers can be free from prejudice but also so that their sons have permission to be vulnerable and human too—reclaim those parts of themselves they abandoned and in doing so be a more true and complete version of themselves.**

　　我希望男性负起这个责任。这样他们的女儿、姐妹和母亲都能够拥有免于偏见的自由，同时，他们的儿子也能被允许脆弱和感性——拥有这些他们曾经摈弃的特质，他们才是更真实和完整的自己。

------

　　**You might be thinking who is this Harry Potter girl?And what is she doing up on stage at the UN. It’s a good question and trust me I have been asking myself the same thing. I don’t know if I am qualified to be here. All I know is that I care about this problem. And I want to make it better.**

　　你可能会想，这个从《哈利波特》里走出的姑娘是谁？她在联合国的讲台上做什么？这是一个好问题。相信我，我也问过自己相同的问题。我不知道我是否够格站在这里。我所知道的是我关心这个问题。我希望它能变好。

------

　　**And having seen what I’ve seen—and given the chance—I feel it is my duty to say something. English statesman Edmund Burke said: “All that is needed for the forces of evil to triumph is for enough good men and women to do nothing.”**

　　同时，因为我目睹过那些事情——并且我又有机会——我感到自己有责任说些什么。英国政治家埃德蒙德？伯克曾说：“恶势力要想取胜很容易，只要足够多的、善良的男人和女人们什么都不做就可以了。”

------

　　**In my nervousness for this speech and in my moments of doubt I’ve told myself firmly—if not me, who, if not now, when. If you have similar doubts when opportunities are presented to you I hope those words might be helpful.**

　　当我为这次演讲感到紧张和疑虑时，我坚定的告诉自己——如果不是我，那又该是谁；如果不是现在，那又该是何时？如果当你面对机会时也有类似的疑虑，希望这些话能对你有所帮助。

------

　　**Because the reality is that if we do nothing it willt ake 75 years, or for me to be nearly a hundred before women can expect to be paid the same as men for the same work. 15.5 million girls will be married in the next 16 years as children. And at current rates it won’t be until 2086before all rural African girls will be able to receive a secondary education.**

　　因为现实是，如果我们什么也不做，那么女性实现与男性同工同酬需要花上75年，而要我说，这恐怕得花上几乎一百年。1550万女孩会在未来16年被迫童婚。同时，按现在的发展速度，在2086年以前，非洲农村都无法实现所有女孩都能接受中等教育。
　　
------

　　**If you believe in equality, you might be one of those inadvertent feminists I spoke of earlier.**

　　如果你相信平等，你可能是我前头说到的那些无心的女权主义者的一员。

------

　　**And for this I applaud you.**

　　为此，我为你鼓掌喝彩。

------

　　**We are struggling for a uniting word but the good news is we have a uniting movement. It is called HeForShe. I am inviting you to step forward, to be seen to speak up, To be the he for she. And to ask yourself if not me, who?if not now when?**

我们正在努力争取一个团结的世界，好消息是，我们已经有了一个团结的运动。它叫做“他为她”。我邀请你站出来，展示自己，畅所欲言，成为一个为女性权益奋斗的男性。以及，问自己：如果不是我，那又该是谁；如果不是现在，那又该是何时！

　　Thank you。
